llvm-general is a set of Haskell bindings for LLVM <http://llvm.org/>. Unlike other current Haskell bindings,
it uses an ADT to represent LLVM IR (<http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html>), and so offers two advantages: it
handles almost all of the stateful complexities of using the LLVM API to build IR; and it supports moving IR not
only from Haskell into LLVM C++ objects, but the other direction - from LLVM C++ into Haskell.
